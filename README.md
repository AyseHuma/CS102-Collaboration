GitHub Assignment 2: Collaboration

For this assignment, we create a tiny Java project with a group of 5 students. 
It is a menu driven application with 5 methods. The students responsible for each method are as such:

a. Doğa -> Given an array size, create an int array that contains random integers in the range [0,100]. All the remaining functionality will operate on this array. <br>
b. Melike -> Display the menu options, get the user’s choice, and call the required methods to print out the result. Until the user chooses to exit, you should display the menu again. <br>
c. Hale Betül -> Find the array's minimum and maximum; these should be implemented as different methods. <br>
d. Ayşe Hüma -> Find the average of the array. Display how each element of the array differs from the average. For example, if the array is {2, 6, 9, 3, 5}, and the average is 5, then the differences from the average would be {-3, 1, 4, -2, 0}. <br>
e. Ömer -> Find the sum of elements with odd- and even-numbered indexes. For example, if the array is {1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 2, 6}, the sum of the odd indexes is 5 + 9 + 2, and the sum of the even indexes is 1 + 8 + 10 + 6, assuming indexes start at 0.
